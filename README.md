# ProofOfIdentity Box

## Project Title
ProofOfIdentity Box

## Project Description
ProofOfIdentity Box is a blockchain-based portable identity verification platform that provides secure, verifiable issuance and authentication of user identity credentials. Developed using Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain, it allows trusted credential issuers to record and verify cryptographically signed identity claims that users can carry across services.

## Project Vision
This platform envisions a world where users control their identities with privacy and portability, presenting verifiable credentials that foster trust without centralized control. By leveraging blockchain immutability and cryptographic signatures, ProofOfIdentity Box enables seamless, user-centric identity validation across decentralized and traditional systems.

## Key Features
- Credential Registration: Issuers upload identity credentials with signature and hash.
- Signature Verification: On-chain verification of issuer-signed credentials.
- Immutable Records: Credentials and verification are permanently stored on-chain.
- Portability & Privacy: Users carry their own verifiable identity tokens without data leakage.
- Timestamped Approval: Each credential is timestamped on the blockchain ledger.
- Public Auditability: Credentials can be transparently queried and validated.
- Secure Access Controls: Only issuers authorize credential registrations.

## Usage Instructions
1. Issuer registers identity credential with cryptographic signature.
2. Verification function confirms authenticity of credential signatures.
3. Any authorized party can query and verify credential information.
4. Users share their credentials securely with services for identity proof.

## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) frameworks and wallets.
- Support for selective attribute disclosure ensuring minimal data exposure.
- Multi-factor and biometric verification integration.
- Smart contract-based revocation and expiration controls.
- Cross-chain identity interoperability.
- User-friendly mobile and web interfaces.

## Technology Stack
- Soroban Rust SDK for smart contract security and efficiency.
- Stellar blockchain providing decentralized, immutable ledger services.
- Cryptography for signature verification, privacy, and data integrity.

## Contribution
Welcomes blockchain developers, identity experts, and privacy advocates to improve platform robustness and functionality. Forks and pull requests encouraged.
